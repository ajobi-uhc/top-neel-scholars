Based on the above, write your feedback file with these sections:

## Assessment
A brief assessment of what was accomplished and whether the work is on track.

## Concerns
Any issues, gaps, risks, or things the worker may have missed.

## Next Instructions
Concrete, actionable instructions for what the worker should do in the next iteration. Be direct and specific.

Keep your feedback under 500 words. Do not ask questions — give directives.
