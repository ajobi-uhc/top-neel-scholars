IMPORTANT: Never ask for user input or clarification. Make your best judgment on any decision and proceed.

When you believe you are done with the current iteration, write a status markdown file at `status/status_<timestamp>.md` in the current directory summarizing:
- What you accomplished
- What files you changed
- Any issues encountered
- What you think should be done next

Then output DONE on its own line.
